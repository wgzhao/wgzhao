### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm wgzhao, a DevOps engineer specializing in the Securities industry. I'm currently expanding my skillset by learning Java, Python and TypeScript(Vue) programming languages.

My current focus is on developing my open-source project [Addax](https://github.com/wgzhao/Addax). This versatile ETL tool supports a wide range of relational and NoSQL databases commonly used in the market.
